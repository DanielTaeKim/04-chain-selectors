# 04-chain-selectors

Utilized chain selectors within css to apply certain attributes to an element that has two specific classes and to apply another set of certain attributes to another element that has two of the specified classes. So even if both may have the 'avatar' class, the element with the 'avatar' AND 'proportioned' class will have different attributes to the element that has the 'avatar' and 'distorted' class.
